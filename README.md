Q. What this app does?

Basic feature is to extract the hidden insight of your blog or article content by comparing with competitors blogs  (...specifically Missing Relevant SEO Keywords and performance of blog) currently feature using visualization (Chart.js Library) and agent using langgraph under the hood
(... currently app isn't really built to grow, and it's missing a bunch of features, especially when it comes to handling agents. Bummer!)


Current Rough design flow of this app i created using eraser.io
