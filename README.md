<h1>Q. What does this app do?</h1>

The basic feature is to extract the hidden insight of your blog or article content by comparing it with competitors' blogs  (...specifically Missing Relevant SEO Keywords and performance of the blog), currently featuring visualization (Chart.js Library) and agent using langgraph under the hood
(... currently, the app isn't built to grow, and it's missing a bunch of features, especially when it comes to handling agents. Bummer!)
